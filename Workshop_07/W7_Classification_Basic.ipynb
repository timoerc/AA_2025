    "Whereas our previous introduction to machine learning focused on the case of predicting real-valued outputs (called the regression setting), these notes consider the case of predicting discrete-valued outputs. This is called the classification setting. And while it may seem as though this would require very different techniques to handle (after all, the regression setting we just considered made very \"continuous\" predictions rather than discrete ones), one nice thing about our generic framework for machine learning is that in reality, there is very little difference between how we handle regression and classification problems. Like before, there are hypothesis functions, loss functions, and our goal is still to solve the canonical problem of minimizing the sum of losses on a data set (the only real difference is in the choice of loss function, as we will see even the hypothesis class largely remains the same)."
