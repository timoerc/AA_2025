    "## Task 1 - Predicting Shared Bike Demand in Seoul\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with a dataset (`SeoulBikeData.csv` in the `data` directory) that contains counts of public bicycles rented per hour in the Seoul Bike Sharing System, with corresponding weather data and holiday information. The dataset is publicly available and you can find further information [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand). Your task is to predict the hourly count of shared bikes based on temperature. Do the following:\n",
    "- Load and inspect the data; perform any clearning steps if necessary.\n",
    "- Define and create a scatter plot of x and y.\n",
    "- Perform a train-holdout-test split.\n",
    "- Train simple, Ridge, and Lasso regression models with polynomial degrees from 1 to 5 and alphas of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 (for Ridge and Lasso). Tune hyperparameters based on holdout performance, select the best performing model based on the mean squared error, and calculate final performance on the test set.\n",
    "- Create a scatter plot of the true values and predictions of the best performing model."
